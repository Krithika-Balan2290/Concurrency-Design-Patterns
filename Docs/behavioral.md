#Behavioral Patterns
Behavioral patterns are design patterns that are explain how the objects react. It describes how different objects and classes interact with each other by sending messages. They objects and classes talk to each other about how to do things and also how to divide a class amongst themselves. Behavioral patterns describe the flow. Behavioral patterns describe the pattern of communication between classes and objects. These patterns use inheritance to distribute communication between classes and objects. There are several kind of behavioral patterns. The template form and interpreter method are the most common type.
Template method is the most common kind of behavioral pattern. The template method makes use of abstract definition of the algorithm. It defines the algorithm step by step. Each step invokes either an abstract operation or a primitive operation. A subclass fleshes out the algorithm by defining the abstract operations. The other kind of pattern is the interpreter method which represents grammar as a class hierarchy and implements an interpreter as an operation on instances of these classes.
There are several other kinds of behavioral patterns like the chain of responsibity and the observer. The other methods of behavioral pattern make use of encapsulation where we encapsulate the algorithm and delegate requests to it.
