#Introduction to Design Patterns

There are many problems faced by a software engineer during Software Design. Since many of these problems are commonly faced by a number of engineers, solutions have been developed which help to tackle these kind of problems. This solution is called design patterns. One definition of a pattern for software architecture is given as<sup>[1](https://github.com/Krithika-Balan2290/Concurrency-Design-Patterns/blob/master/Docs/refs.md)</sup>:

> A pattern for software architecture describes a particular recurring design problem that arises in specific design contexts, and presents a well-proven generic scheme for its solution. The solution scheme is specified by describing its constituent components, their responsibilities and relationships, and the ways in which they collaborate.

Whenever a software engineer faces a common problem in design, knowledge of design pattern helps overcome these problems with lesser effort. A design pattern is only a description of how an engineer can go about solving a particular problem. It cannot be implemented in the code directly, but the steps for implementing the pattern are what is described in the solution.

When software engineers have been working in the field long enough, they understand the common problems faced and the steps to take to solve those problems. Instead of these solutions being available only to some experts, patterns make these problems and their solutions accessible to everyone. *Patterns document existing, well-proven design experience.* Whenever engineers comes up with a new way to solve a problem, they document it so that it is available to anyone else who may face the same problem. This allows better software design irrespective of the experience of the engineer.

A pattern may not involve a single component. A pattern can be made up of a number of objects and classes with different relationships and interactions. These components are all necessary to solve the given problem. A single class with all the required data items and methods may not be sufficient to solve the problem. A design pattern would describe the types of objects needed, the relationships between the objects, what the objects must do and how the objects must interact with each other. These must be implemented by the programmer in order to solve the problem.

Patterns are sometimes so effective that they become part of the software design jargon. The patterns are so widely used that just the name tells software engineers what needs to be done. This could help improve the discussions among the Team about the problems faced and their solutions. Instead of using the specific implementation related names, people can use the name of the role of the component in that design pattern. This increases understanding of how the pattern has been implemented.

A design pattern specifies the different components to be implemented, the roles of each of these components and the interactions between the components. This means that these design patterns provide a basic architecture for constructing more complex systems. Since software engineers do not have to spend time trying to come up with a solution to a problem, they can focus more on the rest of the design for a complex system. This helps improve productivity. 

Software Design patterns also help in implementing functionalities of a system. The design patterns have descriptions of the roles of each component and so they provide a basic overview of the functionalities implemented by each component. Design patterns also help in preserving the original software architecture when changes are made by others at a later point in time. Finally, Software design patterns aids in managing the complexity of the software system. Since we already know the solution to the software problem and how the solution has been implemented, it reduces that much of the complexity of the system. Now the software engineers need to worry about only implementing the rest of the functionalities.
